# UFOs

## Overview of Project: 
Build a webpage and dynamic table of UFO sighting data and then provide a more in-depth analysis by allowing users to filter for multiple criteria at the same time. In addition to the date, add table filters for the city, state, country, and shape.

## Goal:
* Filter UFO sightings on multiple criteria:
    Using JavaScript and HTML, modify the code in the index.html file to create more table filters. In addition to the date filter created in this module, add
    filters for the city, state, country, and shape.


## Results: 
* Entering the website, the client will see the title with a background photo and a basic introduction.

* As the client scrolls further down, they will find all of the data and filters. 
* From the image below, there are 5 different filters to choose from:
    1. date
    2. city
    3. state
    4. country
    5. shape
* The client is able to choose any of these filters enter the search bar and then the HTML page will show all of the sightings for that specific search
* Multiple filters are able to be entered at the same time to further specify the type of data the client is looking for.

## Summary: 
Although this page is clean looking and easy to use, there are some drawbacks. One is that there is no information on how many witnesses there were at these sightings. This would be helpful in validating claims. To improve the website, I recommend adding more data, such as including the number of witnesses, and to also have a site that could be constantly updating the data and adding new/more sitings to this page.
